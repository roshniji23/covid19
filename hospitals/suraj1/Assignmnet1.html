				<h1 align="center">BHOJPUR TEMPLE</h1>
				<p align="center">Bhojpur is situated on the Betwā River, 28 km from Bhopal, the state capital of Madhya Pradesh. The site is located on sandstone ridges typical of central India, next to a deep gorge through which the Betwā River flows. Two large dams, constructed of massive hammer-dressed stones, were built in the eleventh century to divert and block the Betwā, so creating a large lake. The approximate size of the lake is shown in the site plan given here.

				<h1 align="center">Mahaveer Giri Swetamber Jain Temple</h1>
				<p align="center">
					Mahaveer Giri, formerly known as the Manua Bhan Ki tekri, is a hilltop templ with an excellent history. The first time I laid my eyes on this was during my stay at Noor-Us-Sahab Palace.
					On the 1st-morning, when I drew open the curtains, I was greeted by the sight of mountainnscaps wrapped in mild fog.
					As fog unloosed its mist, I could see the ancient Manua Bhan Ki Tekri oe Mhaveer Giri (now named by the city governor) idling on the hilltop. Even though the temple seemed 
					diminutive from the far distance, something about it had me intrigued. Perhaps, its energy!
